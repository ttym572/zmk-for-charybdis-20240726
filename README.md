zmk-config for charybdis nano (3x6)

The keymap is based on daily work/entertainment flow on windows (edge/firefox with vimium), Bloomberg, Excel etc.
1. For now, no use of TapHold or combo functions to maintain a crisp touch (any key can be instantly accessed).
2. Stock ticker input (in Greater China equity space) requires quick number input. Thus specific Number Layer (nLay) to mimic keypad, while left thumb triggers the layer)
3. Excel and other daily windows operation requires a lot of direction (arrow) key and PgUp/Dn etc, thus another layer (dLay) for that. Maintain the flexibility to use Ctrl/Ctrl+Shift with these for Excel.
4. Signs like @$&* are frequently used, but kept in nLay numbers input to simplify layer structure. I'd assume that requires some practice.
5. Function keys are widely used in my AHK (Auto Hot Key) scripts as trigger key, thus maintained in nLay for easy access.
6. Other keymapping are not very different from standard 108 QWERTY layout to ease the new keybaord transfer effort.
